Seating Data Collection
=======================

This is an Android app for real-time data collection on people's seating behavior in trains.

It is configured for Munich's S-Bahn trains which have compartments with each 4 vis-Ã -vis seat groups.
Each seat group has 4 seats.
However it should not be too hard to adapt the app for other seating layouts.
